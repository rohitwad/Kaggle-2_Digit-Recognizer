# Kaggle-2_Digit-Recognizer
Identify Digits Using SVM &amp; CNN

</br>1) Linear SVM
</br>&emsp;-> Tuning only 1 Hyper-parameter2: C
</br>2) Non-Linear SVM (i.e. RBF)
</br>&emsp;-> Tuning 2 Hyper-parameters: C & Gamma
</br>&emsp;-> Gamma : Controls the amount of non-linearity. High value of Gamma, model becomes more non-linear, model complexity increases.
</br>&emsp;-> RBF is radial basis function kernel
</br>&emsp;-> Also used Grid Search Cross-Validation : best way to choose the best combination of these hyperparameters.
